Conceived, coded, and debugged, at the feet (toes?) of Heart Mountain,
between Cody, Wyoming, and Ralston, Wyoming, during the summer of
2000, while choking (exaggeration!) on the smoke of a hundred
surrounding wildfires (most of them upwind) (of course).

Many thanks to the folks at Synopsys for their technical 
assistance and guidance!

Thanks to David Mallis of SI2 for the define_group
fix and testcase.
